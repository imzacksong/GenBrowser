The Gen Browser started as a funny idea talking with friends. A "what if" scenario really. 

What if web pages were generated as you need them, on any topic you needed?

I'm working on a major overhaul of it all currently. But I broke it with a recent update I did so I decided to open source the original version for now.

**Future Improvements**
- Pinokio integration in a sidebar
- Better websites.
- Generating the site images instead of pulling them.
- API integration if you'd like to use OpenAI or Claude models.
- UI Improvements.
